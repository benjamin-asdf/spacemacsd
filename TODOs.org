* Resources
  - go through this
    - https://www.shellscript.sh/variables1.html
  - git-from-the-bottom-up
  - dired
  - registers
  - git manual
* Configs
- figure something out, so crontabs are nicely in git
  - banners:
    - create them with random figlet fonts
  - somehting in savehist becomes too big and doesn't get cleaned
  - fix env stuff somehow, can be temporary, because I won't use gnome forever
  - smartparens doesn't work inside snippets, little annoyance
  - emacs gitlab package, maybe a no brainer actually:
    - https://github.com/nlamirault/emacs-gitlab
* Goals
** artix linux
** try nicolas emacs config
** try doom emacs
*** if I am migrating my stuff I automatically change things so everybody can use it

* Things I would like
** some script that uses ffmpeg and creates screencasts for me, fuck simple screen recorded
* bunel
  - fix symlink
    - save file hook, then move the file?
  - potentially: fuzzy gameobject select
  - selecting is easy: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Selection.html
  - but getting a list of hierachy objects for dmenu.. hm.
* Potential TODOS
  - configure a minimalist mode line
  - then it says something like "Launched a rocked."
* Try fix emacs x11 bug
  Sep 30 07:15:49 benj-pc emacs[4946]: Warning: due to a long standing Gtk+ bug
Sep 30 07:15:49 benj-pc emacs[4946]: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/221
Sep 30 07:15:49 benj-pc emacs[4946]: Emacs might crash when run in daemon mode and the X11 connection is unexpectedly lost.
Sep 30 07:15:49 benj-pc emacs[4946]: Using an Emacs configured with --with-x-toolkit=lucid does not have this problem.
** install emacs with this option, man
   https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/INSTALL.REPO
*** build emacs
    - put the the new build into another dir
    - test if it works
    - then delete the old emacs installation and use the new one
    - cmon man this is easy
* minder
  - some minor mode where I can press a button repeatly
  - automatically push to private repo every 2 hours or something
  - merge timetrack and minder somehow
  - have functions that do the repetetive stuff for timetrack
  - add a user config hook
** merge minder and time track
  - these two functions are almost all I need?
  - well kinda for the beginning that would basically be good enough
*** func minder good morning
    - just push a special message with the wake up time so it's at the top of the file
    - ask "how long did you sleep?"
    - ask for additional message
*** func minder good night
    - would be nice to put the time awake automaticall

** bit bigger mine asteriod funcs
** add a minder hook for commiting,
    should be easy
    hook or this advice-add, whatever that is

** minor mode
  - minder mode, I could put a special character in front of a block of lines
  - then show those differently
** windows
***  make playing sound files from the command line work
**** figure out how to chang the target framework in rider
**** hello world play sound file
**** have a cmd line program that takes a file location as argument
**** update minder to work in all environments
* Need to fix
  - zsh path inside spacemacs is not correct
  - projectile submodules issue
  - fix zsh git auto completion (Guess it still has old version)
  - emacs crashes
  - emacs performance
* conky
* tmux
* i3
* artix
* make rider work
** try with docker
*** milan notes
   it will look something like this for you
FROM <someLinuxDistro>  # have a look into dockerhub
WORKDIR = <someDir>
COPY = <yourProgram> to WORKDIR
CMD <execute program>
(edited)

it is just a sketch but you will need to copy your program there and run it if it is executable
if not you will put installation command there also (edited)
and one more thing which I haven't done you will
probably need to enable X if it is graphical app. I haven't done it, but it will be again some config in Dockerfile.
