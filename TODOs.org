* Resources
  - go through this
    - https://www.shellscript.sh/variables1.html
  - git-from-the-bottom-up
  - dired
  - registers
  - git manual
* Configs
- figure something out, so crontabs are nicely in git
  - banners:
    - create them with random figlet fonts
  - somehting in savehist becomes too big and doesn't get cleaned
  - fix env stuff somehow, can be temporary, because I won't use gnome forever
  - smartparens doesn't work inside snippets, little annoyance
  - emacs gitlab package, maybe a no brainer actually:
    - https://github.com/nlamirault/emacs-gitlab
  - figure out info mode
* Goals
- learn about org
- minder project
- swith to a tiled window manager
* Quick
  - function to comment out all debug.logs in buffer
  - function to yank branch name currenty checked out,
    - maybe a version that pastes immediately
    - maybe another one to do that with the commit sha
  - sxhkd + autoclick script
  - function copy-word-from-below
* Things I would like to have
  - something to search whole project, basically fd with -I
  - or something to search design dir
  - Sailor:
    - "SearchActionHandler"
  - some script that uses ffmpeg and creates screencasts for me, fuck simple screen recorded
* bunel
  - fix symlink
    - save file hook, then move the file?
  - potentially: fuzzy gameobject select
  - selecting is easy: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Selection.html
  - but getting a list of hierachy objects for dmenu.. hm.
* Potential TODOS
  - configure a minimalist mode line
  - then it says something like "Launched a rocked."
* Try fix emacs x11 bug
  Sep 30 07:15:49 benj-pc emacs[4946]: Warning: due to a long standing Gtk+ bug
Sep 30 07:15:49 benj-pc emacs[4946]: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/221
Sep 30 07:15:49 benj-pc emacs[4946]: Emacs might crash when run in daemon mode and the X11 connection is unexpectedly lost.
Sep 30 07:15:49 benj-pc emacs[4946]: Using an Emacs configured with --with-x-toolkit=lucid does not have this problem.
* minder
  - some minor mode where I can press a button repeatly
  - automatically push to private repo every 2 hours or something
  - merge timetrack and minder somehow
  - have functions that do the repetetive stuff for timetrack
  - add a user config hook
** merge minder and time track
  - these two functions are almost all I need?
  - well kinda for the beginning that would basically be good enough
*** func minder good morning
    - just push a special message with the wake up time so it's at the top of the file
    - ask "how long did you sleep?"
    - ask for additional message
*** func minder good night
    - would be nice to put the time awake automaticall

** bit bigger mine asteriod funcs
** add a minder hook for commiting,
    should be easy
    hook or this advice-add, whatever that is

* Need to fix
  - zsh path inside spacemacs is not correct
  - projectile submodules issue
